# TODO List

## Next
- [ ] Test the code for various systems
- [ ] Add examples like two spin 1/2 for ESR or Fe for IETS 
- [x] Add print parameters function 
- [ ] Fix: overflow encountered in exp
- [ ] Structure the class better and add descriptions
- [x] Include the spin pumping in the ESR experiment

## Ideas
- [ ] Improve performance
- [ ] Make it more save by checking for inputs
- [ ] Make it smart that it knows what it has to calculate next, State Management, Parameter file to quickly load parameters, Logging,
