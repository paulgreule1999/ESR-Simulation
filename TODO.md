# TODO List

## Next
- [x] Fix the labeling and amplitude sign of the eigenvectors --> follow the typical convention 
- [ ] Test the code for various systems
- [ ] Add examples like two spin 1/2 for ESR or Fe for IETS 
- [x] Add print parameters function 
- [x] Fix: overflow encountered in exp --> somehow the fixing options makes it slower
- [ ] Structure the class better and add descriptions --> via sub classes??
- [x] Include the spin pumping in the ESR experiment
- [x] Add showing Matrix representation 

## Ideas
- [ ] Improve performance
- [ ] Make Subclasses
- [ ] Make it more save by checking for inputs
- [ ] Make it smart that it knows what it has to calculate next, State Management, Parameter file to quickly load parameters, Logging,
